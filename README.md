# Ensemble Model for Age Prediction

The provided Python code is an example of an **ensemble model** for age prediction from facial images. The idea behind an ensemble model is to combine the predictions of several base models to improve the robustness and performance of the prediction.

## Base Models

In this case, the base models are:

1. **ResNetModel**: This is likely a model based on the ResNet (Residual Network) architecture, which is a popular choice for image classification tasks due to its ability to train deep networks.

2. **InceptionModel**: This is likely a model based on the Inception architecture (also known as GoogLeNet), another popular choice for image classification tasks, known for its efficient use of model parameters.

3. **CNNModel**: This is a generic Convolutional Neural Network model. CNNs are widely used in image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial information.

## Ensemble Model

The `EnsembleModel` class is defined as a subclass of the `nn.Module` class, which is the base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch. The ensemble model takes a list of base models as input and stores them in an `nn.ModuleList`. This is necessary because PyTorch only optimizes the parameters of models that are instances of `nn.Module`.

In the `forward` method, the ensemble model computes the output of each base model and averages them. This is known as **model averaging**, a simple yet effective ensemble method. The assumption here is that each base model is equally reliable. If this is not the case, you might want to assign different weights to the outputs of different models.

Finally, an instance of the ensemble model is created with instances of the base models, and used for prediction on an input image.

Please note that the actual implementations of `ResNetModel`, `InceptionModel`, and `CNNModel` are not provided in the code. You would need to replace these with actual model classes for this code to run.

```python
# Create instances of your models
resnet_model = ResNetModel()
inception_model = InceptionModel()
cnn_model = CNNModel()

# Create an ensemble of the models
ensemble_model = EnsembleModel([resnet_model, inception_model, cnn_model])

# Use the ensemble model for prediction
input_image = # Load your input image
output = ensemble_model(input_image)
